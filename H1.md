## Abstract

- Intrusion detection systems and anti-virus focus on the vulnerability component of risk
- This approaches are insufficient because of an evolution of the goal and sophistication of computer network intrusion
- New class of threats called Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) are now the new adversaries 
- They use advanced tools and techniques 
- To contrast the APT some network defense techniques are adopt. This techniques are based on leverage the knowledges of the adversaries 
- Kill chain model are used to "fight" this kind of adversary
- The evolution of this threats necessitates an intelligence-based model
  - This model attenuate not only the vulnerability but also the risk

### 3.2 Intrusion kill chain 

- Kill chain : systematic process to target and engage an adversary to create desired effects 
- Here the steps :
  - Find (adversary target for engagement)
  - Fix (location)
  - Track (observe)
  - Target (with the objective of create desired effects)
  - Engage (adversary)
  - Assess (effects)
- If one step is missed all the chain will be affected
- This new model is specially for intrusion 
- Intrusion : access without any data permissions in a system or network defusing any security barrier
- Steps of an intrusion kill chain :
  - Reconnaissance (research and definition of target)
  - Weaponization (remote access and exploit into a deliverable payload)
  - Delivery (transmission of the weapon to the targeted environment - USB, email attachments)
  - Exploitation (exploration start with intruders' code)
  - Installation (remote access or back door on the victim system. That is useful to maintain persistence inside the environment)
  - Command and control (C2) - (host "send" beacon to an Internet controller)
  - Actions on objectives (intruders take actions to achieve their original objectives)
- Objectives : 
  - Extracting information 
  - Violation of data integrity or availability 
  - Use the first victim as hop point to compromise additional systems

### 3.3 Courses of Action

- The intrusion kill chain becomes a model for actionable intelligence when defenders based their decisions on the understanding of the adversary. 
- Table 1 : action matrix that use the action of detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, and destroy
- This matrix represent the actions that the defender may take for each phase (Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and control (C2), Actions on objectives)
- Zero day attacks, vulnerability discovered by attackers before the vendor has become aware of it
- The defender key is the resilience. If the defender already have mitigations and the attackers deployed a zero-day attack but reuse observable tools the objective may not be reached. With this defense the cost of the attack will be increased
- Defender can generate metrics of this resiliency by measuring the performance and effectiveness of defensive actions against the intruders. 
- Summary of Table 2 - For each attacks there was at least one mitigation 
  - December : defender detect the weaponization and block the delivery but they find out a new zero-day attack without mitigation
  - March : adversary re-used the same exploit evolving the weaponization so th defensive system was ineffective
  - June : defender improve their capabilities to have detection and mitigations

## Ep 124 : Synthetic remittance

Evaldas Rimasauskas, a man interested in fraud and ways to steal money. When Facebook purchased Instagram, he might have been exploring methods for optimal fraud. He wanted to identify the individuals behind the one-billion-dollar checks used to acquire Instagram. To do this, he teamed up with a friend to gather information through social engineering. Using techniques like checking the LinkedIn profiles of Facebook's accounting department and making calls to request information, they gathered fragments of information to gain a better grasp of the company's internal operations. They started by identifying the companies with which Facebook had the most interaction, and then began employing social engineering tactics to extract information. Evaldas realized that Facebook had extensive interactions with a company named Quanta Computer.

Quanta Manufacturing Nashville specializes in repairing and refurbishing tablets and point-of-sale devices, as well as bill servers, while also providing Cloud computing services.

Once he became aware of this company, Evaldas had all the necessary elements to initiate an attack. He established a company with the same name, headquartered in Latvia. Additionally, he opened a bank account in the company's name. He acquired an invoice from the actual company, duplicated it, and only modified the banking details. This way, the intention was to send the invoice under the company's name but with his account as the recipient for payments.

He executed a BEC scam, a phishing attack that involves assuming the identity of someone the victim (in this case, Facebook) is already familiar with. He crafted a new domain that closely resembled Quanta Computer's legitimate domain.

He dispatched the email and subsequently began receiving funds from Facebook. He noticed that Quanta Computer also had business dealings with Google, so he replicated his approach and began receiving money from Google as well. With his counterfeit invoices, he amassed significant wealth, and he had a sound scheme for laundering the money as well.

To make things more difficult to track he started to sends money in others banks such as in Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Hong Kong. His scheme worked really good. He steal 98 million dollars from Facebook and 23 million dollars from Google. 

After some time, one of the two companies became aware of this fraud. They checked the domain name and discovered that it was linked to Evaldas' personal email address. Following this investigation, the FBI was notified, and Evaldas was arrested in Latvia.

To conclude, this attack wasn't a conventional cyberattack, but it continues to spread rapidly. For this reason, multiple verifications are necessary in such situations. Furthermore, nowadays, there are tools available that can verify domain names that resemble emails and determine domain ownership.

Security within a company is everyone's responsibility.

**I couldn't install Debian. Once the installation is complete, I need to enter my username and password; however, the password is not being recognized. I've attempted several tests, first with actual passwords and then with a password like "123456789," but the result is the same. The virtual machine keeps telling me that my password is incorrect. I tried deleting the virtual machine and creating a new one, but this didn't work.**
