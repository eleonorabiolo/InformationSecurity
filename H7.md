# Firewall

**Install a firewall on Linux and block all ports you don't need to be open.**

```
1. Refresh the package lists from all configured sources
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/b398492a-48e4-4c61-aee9-e358c3590ec6)


```
2. Install UFW (the firewall)
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/45634020-8663-4bbb-9e85-bbd647d099a2)


```
3. Check the status of the firewall. As you can see, the firewall is active. If it is disabled, proceed to the next command
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/5f0adf09-ba0c-4e36-840c-03e18b0ea6c8)


```
4. Enable the UFW
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/a650e2ad-3aad-440e-96d1-1de46e18e521)


```
5. Block all incoming traffic using the firewall/tool
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/02e517c5-d96e-43f2-b7f5-0f884ca92ca7)


```
6. We can open specific ports such as HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/4a3d7c12-007c-4004-95c7-24e0f92bdbf6)


```
7. We can allow network access, at the very least, for services like OpenSSH
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/95ba3d8a-6eea-4247-be3e-f06cdf2b0ba0)


```
8. Verify all the rules you have just applied
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/0139cb6e-4062-4467-8650-8e9640f6cd3d)

# SSHserver

**Install OpenSSH server and connect to it.**

```
1. Update your package list (as we did during the firewall installation)
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/082ef919-cb04-4cf5-aef1-7352e85a70d7)


```
2. Install the OpenSSH server package
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/b23606d1-2990-4385-9d86-9964557d3971)


```
3. Normally, after the installation, the server starts automatically. To be sure, we can check its status
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/46be2885-0971-4a95-ba08-f07aa2d046d8)


```
4. Now it's time to install the openssh-client package
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/4ff4f0d6-6a5f-42a5-956d-ef842c26b1ee)


```
5. Create a new user (you will use this user to test the SSH connection)
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/fb042900-ffbb-4748-acc6-bd39ac01d4f8)


```
6. We can add the new user (Bob) to the sudo group to give him administrative privileges
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/5f9dea50-a74c-4d8d-9607-6231655661cd)


```
7. Enable SSH access for the new user
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/214a2646-d250-4707-8dfb-93eb2806f827)


```
8. Now, you can establish an SSH connection to Bob
```

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/adf1f582-56df-4103-8e1c-f7060c3ceec6)


```
9. Here's the proof that we are now logged in as Bob
```

This command is used to establish an SSH connection to a user named 'tero' on the local machine. To test this command, I created a user named 'tero'
```

*Creating a new user named Tero*

![image](https://github.com/eleonorabiolo/InformationSecurity/assets/71267403/2c56d9b8-0a37-4334-ab8f-adfd42a82f82)

**ssh-keygen**

```
This command is used to generate SSH key pairs for secure authentication and encryption when connecting to remote servers via SSH. It generates two keys: the public key and the private key. You need to generate the key
```
