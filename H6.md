## 1. Tor still works

- The NSA leaks revealed that Tor still provides anonymity, as the NSA has not been able to completely circumvent it.
- The NSA has compromised certain Tor users in specific situations by exploiting vulnerabilities exploiting user misconfigurations.
- Tor's design assumes that if someone is actively monitoring both your network traffic and the network traffic of the service you're communicating with, they may deduce that you're using Tor.
- Tor's security has likely not been compromised at a cryptographic level, but it remains vulnerable to side-channel attacks on browser bugs, user misconfigurations, and traffic correlation attacks.

## 2. Tor is not only used by criminals

- Various types of people use Tor for different purposes:
  - Activists use it to bypass censorship and maintain anonymity.
  - The military relies on it for secure communications and planning.
  - Families use Tor to protect their children and privacy.
  - Journalists use it for research and secure source communication.
- The Tor Project explains that Tor doesn't significantly aid criminals because they have other tools for illegal activities like botnets, stolen devices, and identity theft.
- Using Tor can actually help protect against tactics used by criminals, such as identity theft and online stalking.

## 3. Tor does not have a military backdoor

- Common misconception: some believe Tor was created by the military and must have a military backdoor, but this is false.
- Code is open source, allowing anyone to review it for transparency.
- A team of dedicated privacy and anonymity activists works on Tor, ensuring its integrity and commitment to these principles.

## 4. No one in the US has been prosecuted for running a tor relay

- Running a Tor relay is not believed to be illegal under US law according to EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation).
- While there's no guarantee you won't be contacted by law enforcement, especially when running an exit relay
- Engaging in criminal activity using Tor can lead to legal consequences and additional scrutiny on the Tor network, which is discouraged by the Tor project and can negatively impact the public as a whole.

## 5. Tor is easy to use

- Tor is not difficult to use.
- The simplest way to begin using Tor is by downloading the Tor Browser Bundle, which is pre-configured for secure Tor usage and user-friendly.
- Tails is another easy option.

## 6. Tor is not as slow as you think

- Tor is slower than a regular internet connection, but efforts have been made by Tor developers to improve its speed.
- The Tor network is faster today than it has been in the past.
- One effective way to accelerate the Tor network is to establish more relays.

## 7. Tor is not foolproof

- Tor is not flawless and can compromise anonymity if used incorrectly.
- To maintain anonymity with Tor, it's crucial to use the Tor Browser Bundle or Tails and keep software updated.
- Logging into services like Google and Facebook over Tor may expose your communications to those services.
- Users should be aware that adversaries with access to both ends of the connection may conduct statistical analysis to identify the traffic source.

## Introduction

- Tor  is a modified web browser based on Firefox that conceals a user's IP address, enhancing anonymity.
- It is difficult to trace or identify a user's true IP address when using Tor, making it highly effective for anonymity.
- Tor offers a user-friendly experience, and its simplicity allows practically anyone to use it without technical knowledge. It isser is one of the simplest tools for anonymous internet browsing, freely available for download.

## History and intended use of The Onion Router

- Tor's primary purpose is to enable unrestricted and anonymous internet communication.
- It provides a means to access blocked websites in oppressive regimes, allows whistleblowers to communicate anonymously, and supports private conversations for businesses and individuals.
- Tor, like any tool, can be used for both legitimate and criminal purposes.
- Tor is open for improvement by anyone with technical skills.
- Tor benefits from global contributions from privacy-focused experts to maintain its relevance and effectiveness.

#### Two ways of looking at The Onion Router

- The Tor browser is distinct from other internet browsers in purpose and design, which can pose challenges for forensic analysis.
- Tor is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac
- Another perspective involves investigating suspects currently using Tor, where defeating Tor to capture communications or identify suspects can be challenging.
- Tor presents difficulties for investigators, but it's essential to persist and explore methods that may work for the investigation.

## How The Onion Router works

- Tor routes a user's internet traffic through random relays on the internet to enhance anonymity.
- The data is encrypted using elliptic curve cryptography, which is currently considered unbreakable through brute-force methods.
- Encrypted data enters the first relay (entry), where one layer of encryption is removed and sent to the middle relay.
- The middle relay further removes a layer of encryption and forwards the encrypted data to the last relay (exit).
- The exit relay then establishes an unencrypted connection to the user's intended target.

- Tor directs internet traffic through random relays, with each relay only aware of the previous one, making tracking nearly impossible.
- The route changes every 10 minutes, adding to the complexity of tracking Tor traffic.
- The name "The Onion Router" reflects how data over Tor resembles an onion, with layers of encryption peeled off as it travels through nodes.

#### A few important points about Tor

- The Tor network relies on volunteers who configure servers to act as relays, forwarding encrypted data to the next destination, making it challenging to determine whether an IP address belongs to a user or an innocent relay operator.
- The number of Tor users worldwide is substantial, with over 750,000 users and 6000 relays, making it difficult to identify a single user among many.
- Breaking a Tor circuit, even if possible, involves dealing with legal and diplomatic issues in foreign countries, making it complex to identify Tor users' physical locations.
- The middle node doesn't know the origin or destination of data, enhancing the safety of volunteers running middle nodes.
- Publicly listed Tor relays can be blocked by Internet Service Providers or governments, but "bridges," which are typically not publicly listed, are harder to block, making them useful in countries with internet censorship.
- Tor directory servers maintain information about Tor routers that are publicly listed and accessible for confirmation purposes.

#### From a Tor user’s perspective

- Users need to download and extract the Tor browser bundle, which is a portable application that doesn't require installation.
- The Tor browser is self-executable, making it simple for anyone to use without advanced technical knowledge.
- It can be installed (extracted) to any location on a computer or external media device.
- Default settings suffice for most users, and the configuration step can be completed in just one click.
- Tor is effective both with and without bridges, except in countries with internet censorship where bridges may be required for Tor to work.
- Once configured, Tor is ready to use like any other web browser, offering simplicity and strong anonymity, making it suitable for legitimate and potentially illicit purposes.

#### So what’s the big deal?

- Tor goes beyond just anonymous web browsing; it allows criminals and terrorists to communicate, share files, and target with nearly complete anonymity.
- Without Tor, law enforcement can easily discover information transmitted for criminal activity
- Tor provide webmail service providers with random exit node IP addresses, making it practically impossible to trace back to the originating IP address even when the e-mail address is known.
- By using encryption along with Tor, are users are anonymous online, and the contents of their communications may also be encrypted end-to-end.
- While Tor aims to protect innocent communications, it also provides the same level of protection to criminal and terrorist communications, highlighting the dual nature of its anonymity features.

#### From Your perspective

- Investigating Tor can involve examining either the device on which it was used or analyzing internet traffic utilizing Tor.
- Unmasking Tor is an extremely challenging task
- The legitimacy of Tor's use depends on how it's employed. Tor serves both legitimate and potentially illicit purposes, and its use can vary widely based on the intentions of the user.

## Tracking criminals using TOR

- Tracking Tor users is exceptionally challenging for investigators
- While there have been a few successful cases of breaking Tor's anonymity, these were typically due to exploits in other software used in conjunction with Tor, rather than directly breaking Tor itself.
- Customizing the Tor browser can lead to leaks of information, and even seemingly innocuous changes, like allowing geolocation or certain plugins, can compromise anonymity.
- Researchers have been studying Tor for vulnerabilities and ways to identify users, but many of these methods require significant resources and have limitations.
- Unmasking Tor users often relies on the suspects making errors, such as using non-Tor browsers or engaging in risky behaviors that reveal their true IP addresses.
- Investigators can sometimes capitalize on the mistakes of suspects, such as seeding emails with tracking codes to obtain IP addresses, or by leveraging information from the open web to identify suspects operating in the Dark Web.
- In some cases, internal network administrators may have an advantage in identifying Tor users within their network, as they can see when Tor is being accessed, which can be correlated with potential threatening activities.
